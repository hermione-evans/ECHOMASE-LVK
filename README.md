This repository serves as the supplementary material for our paper: [Wu et al., arXiv:2512.xxxxx](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.xxxxx). It contains the source code, analysis pipeline, and summary data required to reproduce the figures and results presented in the paper.
Due to size constraints, we're not able to provide the full posterior files. We may add compressed posterior files to run the code, which gives similar results to the full posterior .


## Repository Structure
The repository is organized to mirror the structure of our paper. Below is a detailed description of the contents:


- `./validation`: Code and data for the methodology validation (Sec. IV).
    - violin_plot.ipynb: Generates violin plots for Figure 1 and Figure 3.

    - echo_waveform.ipynb: Generates the echo waveform illustration in Figure 2.

    - posterior.ipynb: Generates the posterior distributions in Figure 4.

    - PE.csv: Contains the best-fit values for the validation study (used in Table II).
<!-- - This directory contains the code and data used to validation our search method. violin_plot.ipynb contains the code generate the violin plots in Figure 1 and Figure 3; echo_waveform.ipynb contains the code to generate the echo waveform in Figure 2; posterior.ipynb contains the code to generate the posterior distributions in Figure 4. The PE.csv file contains the best-fit values for the validation study shown in Table II. -->
- `./search_results/`: Results from the search in real LVK data (Sec. V).
    - violinplot_background.ipynb: Generates background analysis plots for Figure 5 and Figure 6, and calculates data for Table IV.
    - violinplot_event.ipynb: Generates the posterior distributions for the events in Figure 7.
<!-- 2. `./search_results`: This directory contains the code and data used to search for gravitational wave echoes in LVK data. violinplot_background.ipynb contains the code to generate the violin plots in Figure 5 and Figure 6, the data in Table IV is also calculated in this file; violinplot_event.ipynb contains the code to generate the violin plots in Figure 7. -->
- `./appendix/`: Supplementary results presented in the Appendix.
    - appendix_figures.ipynb: Generates Figure 8, Figure 9, and Figure 12.
    - violin_app_b.ipynb: Generates the violin plots in Figure 10 and Figure 11.
<!-- 3. `./appendix`: This directory contains the code and data used to generate the results presented in the Appendix of our paper. appendix_figures.ipynb contains the code to generate FIgure 8, Figure 9, and Figure 12. violin_app_b.ipynb contains the code to generate the violin plots in Figure 10 and Figure 11. -->
- `python_files_*`/: Templates of Python scripts used to perform the Bayesian analysis on supercomputing clusters.
- `outdir_*`/: Summary statistics of the posterior samples generated by the analysis.
<!-- Each folder with prefix `outdir_` contains the summary statistics of posterior samples. Each folder with prefix `python_files_` contains the template of python files to perform Bayesian analysis. `environment.yml` contains the conda environment to run the python files. -->
